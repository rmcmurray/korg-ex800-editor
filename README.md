# Korg EX-800 Editor

This application is a GUI-based Editor/Librarian for the Korg EX-800 Synthesizer that is written in C# and .NET. (I would imagine that it might work with the Korg Poly 800 as well, but I have not tested it.)

Note that it has a dependency on Leslie Sanford's [C# MIDI toolkit (Sanford.Multimedia.Midi)](https://github.com/tebjan/Sanford.Multimedia.Midi), which you can install using Package Manager:

```
Install-Package Sanford.Multimedia.Midi
```
